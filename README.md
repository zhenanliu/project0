# Proj0-Hello
Trivial project to exercise version control, turn-in, and other
mechanisms.

## Instructions:

- Start by forking this repository on github, then cloning onto your
  development machine. 

- Copy the credentials-skel.ini file to credentials.ini and fill in
  appropriately. 

- Modify the program "hello.py" so that it prints "Hello
  world". (Nothing more and nothing less.)  Note that you do NOT do
  this by changing the hello.py source file.  Rather, the message is a
  configuration constant from the credentials.ini file; fix it there. 

- Replace these instructions with a proper README including the
   author, contact address, and a brief description of what the 
   software does.

- Test your program locally;  revise and re-test as needed.  (How long
  can it take, really?)

- Commit your changes.  You will need to use "git add" on your files
   hello.py and README.md, but *not* on credentials.py, because that
   file does not belong on github.  (In later projects it will contain
   confidential information, like access keys and passwords for web
   services.)  Your changes must be "pushed" to your public repository
   on github so that the auto-checker can "clone" them back to the
   grading machine.

- Test your code with the auto-checker.  Revise and push changes
   as needed.

- Turn in with Canvas.  The file you turn in is credentials.ini.  We
   use the repository link in your credentials.ini to access the rest,
   just like the auto-checker.
